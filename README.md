SPRING BOOT MICROSERVICE EXAMPLE
--------------------------------

This is a little example of microservice wrapped into a Docker container.

If you want to run it please use the following maven instruction:


<code>
mvn clean install docker:build
</code>

Take into account that you will need to modify the pom.xml in order to point to the right Docker host ip address.
